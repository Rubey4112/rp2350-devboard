This is my journal of the design and building process of **RP2350 Devboard**.

## 10/5/2025 - Research and Power Routing  

### Inspiration
I saw the guide on how to create your own RP2040 devboard by Kai Pereira on the sidebar of Blueprint and decided to have a go at it. Rather than using an RP2040 as the main chip, I decided to use the RP2350A for my devboard because it has a dedicated floating point unit.

Further more, I wanted to make some improvement to the base Pi Pico 2:
- USB-C rather than Micro-B
- Pin labels on top rather than on the bottom
- A dedicated reset button

I also wanted to gain experience of designing a devboard so that I can use it when designing my own custom keyboard since I want to have the MCU on the board directly rather than have it on a separate module.

### Progress 
A lot of time was spent reading the Blueprint guide and reading the fantastically documented Raspberry Pi [_Hardware design with RP2350_](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/hardware-design-with-rp2350.pdf).
For today, I finished wiring the decoupling capacitors, the 1.1V switching regulator, and the USB-C input.

## 10/6/2025 - Schematic Finished  

A lot of the time was spent reading the RP2350 hardware design documentation and learning what each components does. If I were to do this again then I will probably finish this way faster.

To Do:
- Assign footprints
- PCB layout
- Silkscreens!
- Export fabrication files
- Get quote from JLCPCB (and PCBWay)
- Ship!

Completed:
- Schematic design
  - MCU
  - USB-C power
  - Flash memory
  - Crystal oscillator
  - I/O headers
  - Reset button
